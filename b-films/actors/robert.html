        Robert Douglas Thomas Pattinson was born May 13, 1986 in London, England, to Richard Pattinson, a car
                    dealer importing
                    vintage cars, and Clare Pattinson (n√©e Charlton), who worked as a booker at a model agency. He grew up
                    in Barnes,
                    southwest London with two older sisters. 
                </p>
                <p> Robert discovered his love for music long before acting and
                    started learning
                    the guitar and piano at the age of four. He became a big cinephile for love of auteur cinema in his
                    early teens and
                    preferred to watch films rather than doing his homework. In his late teens and early twenties, he used
                    to perform solo
                    acoustic guitar gigs at open mic nights in bars and pubs around London where he sung his own written
                    songs. Thinking
                    about becoming a musician or going to university to study speech-writing, he never thought about
                    pursuing an acting
                    career and his drama teacher in school even advised him not to join the drama club because she thought
                    he wasn't made
                    for the creative subjects. But as a teenager, he joined the local amateur theatre club after his father
                    convinced him to
                    attend because he was quite shy. At age 15 and after two years of working backstage, he auditioned for
                    the play 'Guys
                    and Dolls' and he got his first role as a Cuban dancer with no lines. He got the lead part in the next
                    play 'Our Town',
                    was spotted by a talent agent who was sitting in the audience and he began looking for professional
                    roles.</p>
